# emissions
Developed an algorithm that integrates and matches data from various databases to accurately calculate corporate emissions, enabling the stakeholders to assess companies' environmental impact more effectively.
The data_prep.py file is cleaning and organising the data from the two databases (downloaded in csv form)  so that they can be analysed from the next file location_matching.py in which the data points from the two sets are matched.
